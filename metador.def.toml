# Default configuration file for Metador.
#
# You can and should override some of those values in your own config.
# All entries that are missing in your config will take the following default values.
#
# For readability, you can remove everything that you do not need to change.
#
# NOTE: relative file/directory paths will be interpreted relative to CWD,
# NOT relative to location of this config.
#
# A minimal deployment configuration with ORCID and behind a reverse proxy will need:
# metador.site, metador.tusd_endpoint, orcid.enabled, orcid.client_id, orcid.client_secret
# For a possible setup, check out the example nginx configuration file.

# With reverse proxy for https, this can be e.g. https://your-domain.com
site = 'http://localhost:8000'

# The endpoint URL for file uploads that is accessible from client (with trailing slash).
# It depends on the -base-path of tusd and the way you proxy/route/serve requests to it.
#
# With reverse proxy for https, this can be e.g. https://your-domain.com/tusd/files/

#
# If it is not an URL, it is interpreted as a shell command or script that is run when a
# dataset is complete with DATASET_PATH as extra positional argument.
